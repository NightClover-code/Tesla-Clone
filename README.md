## Tesla Website Clone (Rebuilt and Upgraded)

This is a clone of the official tesla website. the purpose of this project is to try to make a better clone,
and add better functionality and user experience.

## How it was made

I made this website using React.js and some javascript libraries for the scrolling effects and animations, such as jump.js, scroll magic, and AOS. The styling was made with styled-components (mainly), and also sass which was used to add additional styling.

## Code Reviews

I'm pretty new to React, so feel free to review my code and tell me how I can improve it.

## Note

I'm still working on this website, trying to make it better and fix any bugs that can occur.

## Using the website

To use this website, download the cloned repository and make sure to install all the dependencies using the command `npm install` (or yarn) in your terminal.

Run `npm start` (or yarn) to open the server.

Have fun ;)
